============

Creating something out of nothing.

Creating businesses by volunteering first and making money together after the launch.

It's a way of crowdsourcing but with the option to pay out in promises of future income.

Of course there is risk involved, but it's carried by everyone contributing, and everyone should benefit the same as soon as a project has become successful.

I want everyone with a skill and/or idea to be able to connect with others with other skills to create something together which will make money as soon as the first products are published.

Silicon Alley is in the idea fase. I, Bart Visser, am learning python the hard way and I'll do my best to work it out so that it becomes more real and "tangible".

I'm an absolute beginner here, so any help is welcome. I registered the domain name: siliconalley.nl

My email is: bart@siliconalley.nl

I need help with:

1: Developing the idea
2: Developing the user experience
3: Making it work
4: Maintenance

Thank you,

Bart Visser
